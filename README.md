**MA graduate in Data Information, focused on analytics and data insights.**

This repository contains a collection of my notebooks showcasing various projects and analyses.

Below are links to the notebooks:

- [Penalty Word Cup Notebook](penalty_word_cup%20(1).ipynb)

  This project analyzes penalty-related issues in the FIFA World Cup, focusing on patterns, success rates, and key insights. The workflow included extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by a thorough analysis of trends and outcomes.
Python libraries such as Pandas were used for data manipulation, while Seaborn and Matplotlib helped visualize the results through clear and insightful charts. Additionally, a time-series analysis was conducted to uncover trends over different time periods 

- [Flights Rating Notebook](Ex3_Visualization.ipynb)

  This project analyzes flight ratings data to uncover trends and insights related to passenger satisfaction. Using Python, we performed data preprocessing and visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib. The analysis focused on various factors, including delays, in-flight services, and airport experiences, to explore their impact on passenger satisfaction.

This work was carried out as a collaborative effort with two fellow students, combining statistical analysis and visual storytelling to present findings effectively.

- [Iris Analysis Notebook](iris_YN.ipynb)
  
   **Exploration of the Iris dataset**, demonstrating data visualization techniques and classification models for species prediction.
